# IS 597 PRO Fall 2020 Final Project

## Title: Twins City COVID-19 Spreading Monte Carlo Simulation
## Author: Erick Li

### Introduction
COVID-19, the maniac that messed up the year of 2020, spreaded all over the world. It caused a major disruption especially on international travels. Human has to learn something from it, right? This project aims to find out how should a government reacts to such an international crisis. How should they implement travel restrictions or traveler quarantine?

In the imaginary world, there are only two cities--A & B (simple enough to remember, hmm?). There is a train service between A & B. In my simulation, people can only travel from A to B, and the travel time can be ignored. Some people in City A got COVID-19 mysteriously. How should City B react?

### Hypothesis
Implementing travel restrictions or mandatory quarantine can significantly help prevent the virus from spreading from City A to City B.

### Scenarios
#### One: Without any restrictions

#### Two: City B quarantines people who shows symptoms

#### Three: City B quarantines all travelers from City A
